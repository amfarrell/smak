Installing Coffeescript on ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
wget http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/tarball/master
tar -xvvf jashkenas-coffee-script-1.2.0-139-g53fe10e.tar.gz
sudo bin/cake install
coffee --help

Using coffeescript
echo "alias coffeesmak='coffee -o ./javascript/ -cw ./coffeescript/ &'" >> ~/.bashrc
# Note that you might want to point to the absolute paths to this project.
# such as /home/afarrell/projects/ui/smak/coffeescript
source ~/.bashrc
then, every time you start editing code, run
coffeesmak

To start:
`git clone git@github.com:afarrell/smak.git`
`git branch (chris|danica|andrew)`
`git checkout (chris|danica|andrew)`
==============================
If you are unsure of the status of the repo, 
`git status` or even `gitk`

To edit:
--------
*edit some file*
`git add $filename`
`git commit -m "starting a new feature to frobnicate the toggle."`
*edit some more*
`git add $filename`
`git commit --amend`
until you are finished with the feature, editing the commit message as necessary.
When you are, 
`git push origin (chris|danica)`
`git fetch` to grab updates to other peoples code.

To merge:
---------
Suppose chris sees that everything in danica's branch is useful to him, 
then he can pull it into your own branch with
`git merge danica`
likewise, danica might do
`git merge chris`

The branch `prod` is for stuff we're sure we want to keep, which we should
be careful about committing to.
The branch `scratch` is the very opposite.

Coffeescript - cleaner javascript.
==================================
See http://coffeescript.org/

sudo apt-get install nodejs npm &&
sudo npm install coffee-script

It compiles to clean-looking javascript.
We want to make writing coffeescript dead-simple.

run `coffee --watch --compile example.coffee -o`
for any coffeescript, and the javascript will 
update automatically. 

todo: have vim do this on `w`
