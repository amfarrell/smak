To start:
`git clone git@github.com:afarrell/smak.git`
`git branch (chris|danica|andrew)`
`git checkout (chris|danica|andrew)`
==============================
If you are unsure of the status of the repo, 
`git status` or even `gitk`

To edit:
--------
*edit some file*
`git add $filename`
`git commit -m "starting a new feature to frobnicate the toggle."`
*edit some more*
`git add $filename`
`git commit --amend`
until you are finished with the feature, editing the commit message as necessary.
When you are, 
`git push origin (chris|danica)`
`git fetch` to grab updates to other peoples code.

To merge:
---------
Suppose chris sees that everything in danica's branch is useful to him, 
then he can pull it into your own branch with
`git merge danica`
likewise, danica might do
`git merge chris`

The branch `prod` is for stuff we're sure we want to keep, which we should
be careful about committing to.
The branch `scratch` is the very opposite.
